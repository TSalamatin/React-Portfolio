https://tsalamatin.github.io/React-Portfolio/

## Description
 This is my portfolio starting in React, as I begin to upload more complicated projects and develop my skills, I will update my portfolio to reflect my coding journey. 
 For the time being are attached simple projects and thir deployments. I plan to use Github API to loop through my public projects, and display them on my portfolio
